Supports deployment of distributed algorithm scenarios.
The project was developed along with the 'Kompics performance tests' benchmark suite as a supplementary Erlang implementation.

Tha Kompics performance tests suit can be found here:

Currently contains a typical NN atomic register implementation that tests messaging capabilities and a Quorum Based Key value store implementation that uses lazy merkle tree hash validation for maintaince.
